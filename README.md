# Purpose of this repository

1. To store sample projects from following along a tutorial to learn the basics of Angular
2. Allowing me to always refer back to it to build on them after each chapter to see what else I can do with Angular


# Projects

The repository will be filled with tutorial projects and whatever changes I make to those projects or creation of projects in a similar vein to the tutorial I am following to learn this <br />
frontend framework alongside TypeScript and JavaScript. <br />

# Things Learned so far

Until chapters are completed this space will be left blank.
